Fulcrum
=======

To view demo

* Pull code
* Create database called Fulcrum (or update connection strings in app/web.configs)
* Build
* Run update-database
* Set API Test Harness as startup project & run it
* Using Postman issue GET requests to /commands or /queries


Goals
======

Fulcrum provides an HTTP-based self-describing API as well as the runtime infrastructure necessary to publish commands and execute queries.

The seed project will integrate Fulcrum with Identity Server v3 and Membership Reboot, along with Angular, angular-schema-form, TV4.js, Bootstrap CSS, and other libraries to provide a default project which can be used to kickstart new development.
