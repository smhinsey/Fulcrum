   awesome PR.
 * New format for 'titleMap', it can now also take a list.
 * Checkboxes have proper two way binding.
 * Validate entire form with $scope.$broadcast('schemaFormValidate')
 * If there is no title in neither schema nor form it defaults to the property
   name from the schema.
 * 'sf-options' attribute for globals options, with an option for form defaults.
 * Added 'ng-model-options' so Angular 1.3 users can validate on blur.
 * All validation, even required is now using tv4js, change 'validationMessage'
   accordingly. This means arrays validate.
 * 'Checkbox' type implies a default of false if none is set.
 * Changed tactics when it comes to bower deps, it now only depends on what you
   cannot go without, i.e. tv4, angular, angular-sanitize and objectpath. You
   have to add bootstrap and other dependencies manually (a lot are optional).
 * Lots of small bugfixes.

 @torstenrudolf and all of you who made a lot of issues and PR:s this summer!
